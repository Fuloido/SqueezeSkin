This is a modificated skin for the SqueezePlay software. Based upon the WQVGAsmallSkin.

This version mainly change the resolution to 1024x768 and adapt some of the content to this new resolution, especially the "NowPlaying" page.


TODO (well if you dare, if I have time)

 - Add the current or part of the playlist in the NowPlaying page, on the side, on top, bottom etc
 - Add some more information on that screen
 - Add some easy shortcuts for PC (direct delete etc, I think it must be done on an over apllet)
 - Add some icons for the current track like file format, quality etc
